Installation
============

To install ``{package_name}``, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+{package_url}

Or clone the repository and install it manually:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone {package_url}

Then, go to the directory and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .

Use ``-e .[dev]`` to install it with the development dependencies.
